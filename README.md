# Config Files

## .bash_profile

I mostly just use this for basic config of my shell. Just the basic commands/aliases that I use often. I won't really touch this files and any machine specific configs should go in the `.bashrc` file.

## vimrc

This is the current version of my fully decked out vimrc. I have a basic version named `basic.vim` which just changes my keybindings if I want a basic config that feels pretty good for any machine I won't be using often.

## setupscripts

This contains 4 files. One for setting up an ubuntu machine, one for installing the dracula vim theme (mostly for use in not commonly used machines) and a file for installing vim-plug for a machine where I might want to use often. The last file is a general purpose setup script. I just need to put in the name of the package manager and it should hopefully just work. However I can manually config just using the script as a template if needed.
